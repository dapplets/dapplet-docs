title: 'Dapplet Initial Stake'
---

When creating a dapplet the author needs to place an Initial Stake with the AUGE token to reserve a place in the registry.

The minimum stake amount is set by the system and can only be changed by a collective vote of the Dapplets DAO participants. The maximum stake amount is not limited and can be set by the creator of the dapplet.

After a working dapplet has been uploaded to the registry and approved by the auditor, the Initial Stake that was placed by the creator can be returned.
