Any Dapplets Platform user can become a part of Dapplets DAO and actively participate in the project’s ecosystem governance. 

To receive voting rights in the DAO the user must form a stake from AUGE tokens and lock them to the staking for a certain period of time. 

Voting rights are received by the account in exchange for the blocked AUGE tokens. The longer the stake is blocked the more voting rights a user gets for 1 blocked AUGE token.

At the end of the lock period the voting rights are canceled and the user is able to receive their AUGE tokens back or extend the stake’s blocking period.
