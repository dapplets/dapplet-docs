The dapplet name and spot in the registry are reserved for a certain amount of time only, this amount is set by the Dapplets DAO. If the dapplet author fails to upload a functioning dapplet to the catalog within the set amount of time, they will need to double their stake to keep the name and spot that have been reserved. 

If the dapplet creator doesn’t upload a working dapplet and does not wish to double the AUGE Stake amount, the Initial stake is burned. Any user that visits the catalog and finds an Under Construction dapplet that’s past its due date can launch the transaction that burns the Initial Stake. They will then receive a reward in the form of a % from this Stake.
