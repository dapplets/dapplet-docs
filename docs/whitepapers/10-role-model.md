Dapplets community is built on the principles of self-organization and assumes several roles within it. Each of the roles is economically motivated to participate.

## User

Users install and use dapplets because these dapplets are able to solve their problems and provide the functionality they need.

## Lister (advanced user)

Listers are a special role unknown in the classical web. Their job is to select the most interesting apps and make a list of them. Popular Listers can be rewarded by developers for listing their apps.

## Owner/Developer

Owners publish apps made by Developers because these apps help drive their business processes or can be monetized through user acquisition.

## Auditor (advanced developer)

Auditors review the app's code and are responsible for making sure itâ€™s safe for the end user. They can be rewarded by both developers and end users. Auditors are advanced developers.
