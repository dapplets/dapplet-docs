_Pic. A User gets voting rights in the DAO_

1. A user acquires AUGE tokens.
1. The user sends the necessary AUGE amount to the staking to receive voting rights.
1. The amount of votes received by the user depends on the staking term.
1. The user takes part in DAO voting and uses their voting rights.
1. After the staking term is finished, the users is able to receive their AUGE tokens back. The remaining voting rights are voided upon withdrawal.

### Further development

Voting Power Module (VPM) realizes a standard interface, which connects it to the setting module of the Dapplets ecosystem. VPM implementation may be redefined and replaced later.
