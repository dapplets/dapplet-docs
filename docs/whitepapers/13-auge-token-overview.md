AUGE is a native utility ecosystem token.

AUGE emission is based on the Bonding Curve model. The Bonding Curve is a form of a smart contract that buys and sells tokens, based on the price formula thatâ€™s been introduced.

In this example, the X-axis represents the total amount of tokens released (_Q_), and the Y-axis represents the current price of the token (_P_). The relationship between the amount and the price can be shown as a formula, and in this specific graph is depicted as the _BC curve_.

The token bonding curve is the primary market-maker that is forming the supply of tokens and their price. Later it turns from market-maker to price indicator as other markets arise.
