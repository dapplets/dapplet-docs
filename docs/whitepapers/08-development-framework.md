The platform's goal is to provide the dapplet developer with tools and services for rapid dapplet development. 

It features out-of-the-box tooling for:
* access to crypto wallets
* rapid augmentation development
* versioning and dependency management

Because of that:
* a simple dapplet is about 100 lines of code and takes only a few hours to develop.
* a dapplet can be developed without any additional tools and services.
