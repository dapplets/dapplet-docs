When creating the token and the individual Bonding Curve for the dapplet, a developer may provide an additional Collateral Stake to receive the following privileges:

1. The Collateral Stake can be used in the first transaction made by the Bonding Curve. The Collateral Stake token will be sent to the curve to execute the first transaction on this curve. The first transaction will allow the dapplet creator to mint the dappletâ€™s tokens at the lowest price possible.
1. Collateral Stake can be used (fully or partially) for motivating adapter developers to enable the changes necessary for dapplet creation. You can read more about motivating adapter developers in the next section.
