The AUGE token is created as a utility token and has many ways it can be implemented within the Dapplets Project ecosystem. 

The AUGE token can be used as:

* an Initial Stake for adding a dapplet to the registry in “Under Construction“ status;
* a collateral when creating and using individual dapplets' Bonding Curves;
* as the stake for the decision made in ecosystem governance;
* an Auditor’s Stake that allows you to conduct and confirm dapplet audits;
* a payment for ads in popular Listers' dapplet lists.

Even though dapplet creation is free, Dapplets Platform requires Owners to stake some AUGE tokens to prevent spam.
