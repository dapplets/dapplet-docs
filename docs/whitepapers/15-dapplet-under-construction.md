title: "Dapplet “Under Construction”"
---

Any dapplet can be created as *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*. This allows the creator to reserve the dapplet name and space in the registry, even without any code or assets. The dapplet becomes operational when its functioning implementation has been uploaded.

The Under Construction status allows the author to reserve the dapplet’s name. Furthermore, an Under Construction dapplet can already be added to listings and be visible to Dapplets Platform users. 

This status gives the Owner of the app extra time to look for a development team or for funds to finance the project.
