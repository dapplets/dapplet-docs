### We would like our protocol to meet the following requirements:
* The protocol *MUST* be permissionless, resilient and cryptographically secure.
* The protocol *SHOULD* be economically self-sustainable and not rely on grants or voluntary work.
* The protocol *SHOULD* NOT enforce any upgrades or updates. This SHOULD solely be a user’s decision.
* The protocol *MUST* be extensible and support any content type.
* The protocol *SHOULD* recover ASAP from unpredicted content type changes.
* The protocol *MUST* support continuous and adaptive content type discovery.

### We would like the implementation to meet the requirements as follows:
* The implementation *SHOULD* provide standard libraries to simplify apps as much as possible.
* The augmentation *SHOULD* neither interfere with the content nor change it in an undesired way. 
* A user *SHOULD* be able to distinguish between the content and its augmentation.
