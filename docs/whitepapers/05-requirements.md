### We would like our protocol to meet the following requirements:

- The protocol _MUST_ be permissionless, resilient and cryptographically secure.
- The protocol _SHOULD_ be economically self-sustainable and not rely on grants or voluntary work.
- The protocol _SHOULD_ NOT enforce any upgrades or updates. This SHOULD solely be a userâ€™s decision.
- The protocol _MUST_ be extensible and support any content type.
- The protocol _SHOULD_ recover ASAP from unpredicted content type changes.
- The protocol _MUST_ support continuous and adaptive content type discovery.

### We would like the implementation to meet the requirements as follows:

- The implementation _SHOULD_ provide standard libraries to simplify apps as much as possible.
- The augmentation _SHOULD_ neither interfere with the content nor change it in an undesired way.
- A user _SHOULD_ be able to distinguish between the content and its augmentation.
