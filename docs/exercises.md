In this section we will look at how to use and implement the basic elements of the dapplet structure.
If you went through [Get started](/docs/get-started) you had to install the
[Dapplet Template](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-template) locally and change some params in the master branch.

In addition to master branch, there are numbered brunches with examples marked as `-exercise` and `-solution`.

Each of the following topics corresponds to examples in the same order. You can change the `exercise` templates locally according to this tutorial or try to implement them yourself and compare with the `solution`.

All the main areas in the code of exercises to be changed are marked with `LP` *(Learning Points)* comments:

```js
// LP: 1. Add a label with a counter for it.

// LP end
```

You can find them all with `// LP:` search query.

If you are using **Visual Studio Code** you can try the **Git Graph** extension to compare your solution with ours.

Also you can **directly run the example's solution**, see how it works, and **use it as a template** for your project.
