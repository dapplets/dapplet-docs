### I’m a developer interested in your technology, where do I start?


Thanks, and welcome aboard!

[Here](/docs/get-started) you can find how to quickly create a basic dapplet.

We also have documentation and [exercises](/docs/exercises/) which you can complete to deepen your knowledge and create advanced and fully functional applications on our platform.

We also have a video recording of our [workshop](https://hackmd.io/@heL9DJloSkKGQOtdOicgaQ/B1qZtuIY9) with EPAM: [Dapplets Project: «Practical Web3 programming experience»](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB0-iBByXuA) 

Furthermore, don’t miss our public list of [dapplet ideas](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplets-ideas). You can take whichever one you like and realize it!



### Where can I find different dapplets to try them out?


Download our [extension](/docs/installation/). 

Go to Twitter or YouTube. 

In the extension you will see several dapplets that work on these webpages. 

Try them out!


### Where can I find a template to create a module?


We have a create-dapplet-app node-based utility with which you can create dapplets, adapters, or interfaces. For use it, run:

`npx create-dapplet-app`

More info about settings you can find [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-dapplet-app).



### The extension doesn’t work. I don’t see any dapplets, what do I do?


Begin by opening the desired website (Twitter, YouTube etc.) and clicking on the Dapplets extension. It should show you a list of dapplets that can be used on this website.

If this doesn’t help please check that you have the latest version of the extension. Unfortunately, the extension is not yet updated automatically and we have a fast-paced development process. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-extension/releases/latest).

If your version in outdated delete it and download the correct one. 

If the issue remains take a screenshot and contact us through [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/569770026412933140/993845099580641312) or [Telegram](https://t.me/dapplets).



### Which browsers does your extension support? Is there a version for mobile\android?

Currently, the Dapplets Extension only works on desktop and does not support androids\mobiles.

It's best to use Chrome or Brave browsers.



### Where can I send messages about issues I encounter? Share my suggestions? or ideas\partnership offers?
