### I'm a developer and I'm interested in your technology, what's the best way for me to get started?

Thank you, welcome aboard! How to quickly create a simple dapplet can be found [here](https://docs.dapplets.org/docs/get-started). There is also documentation and exercises that you can go through to deepen your knowledge and [create full-fledged applications](https://docs.dapplets.org/docs/exercises/) on our platform. And here are the [materials](https://hackmd.io/@heL9DJloSkKGQOtdOicgaQ/B1qZtuIY9) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB0-iBByXuA) from our workshop: EPAM Blockchain Professionals Workshop - HackMD Dapplets Project: "Practical Web3 programming experience".

And do not forget that we have a public list of ideas for dapplets, take the one you like and implement [it](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplets-ideas).



### And where can I see what dapplets are generally available to try?

Install [Extension](https://docs.dapplets.org/docs/installation/) and go, for example, to twitter or YouTube. Dapplets that work on these resources will automatically appear in the extension.



### My extension doesn't work, I don't see any dapplets in the list, what should I do?

To get started, you should open the desired website (twitter, youtube etc.) and click the Dapplets icon. It will show the list of dapplets that can be used on this site. 

If this does not help, make sure you have the latest version of the extension installed. There is no automatic update yet, and development is underway. The current release is available [here](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-extension/releases/latest).If your version is older, uninstall it and install the latest one.

If the problem still persists, please take a screenshot and send it to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/569770026412933140/993845099580641312) or [Telegram](https://t.me/dapplets).



### What browsers does your extension currently work in, is there any mobile support? Android?

Android and mobile versions are currently not supported. It is best to use Chrome or Brave.



### Where to send error messages? Share ideas? Cooperation proposals?
