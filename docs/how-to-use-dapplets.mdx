You can also download the extension as a zip archive and install it directly into your browser. The project is open source, so you can always find the [latest version of the application](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-extension) on the project page on GitHub.

You can pin Dapplets extension button and click on it to open the overlay.

#### 7. To display other dapplets, you need to add other **Trusted users** in the extension settings

By default, several trusted users are added. Click the drop-down arrow to view them.

If you know some user who has a list of dapplets you are interested in, add his address in the input and you will see his dapplets in your dapplet list.
You can find truster users in the [Dapplets store](https://store.dapplets.org/).
