You can also download the extension as a zip archive and install it directly into your browser. The project is open source, so you can always find the [latest version of the application](https://github.com/dapplets/dapplet-extension) on the project page on GitHub.

You can pin Dapplets extension button and click on it to open the overlay.

If the overlay does not open when you click on the extension button, you need to refresh the page in the browser. This happens when the extension is launched for the first time.

##### 8. Trusted users

To display other dapplets, you need to add other Trusted users in the extension settings.
By default, several trusted users are added. Click the drop-down arrow to view them.

If you know some user who has a list of dapplets you are interested in, add their address in the input and you will see their dapplets in your dapplet list.
You can find truster users in the [Dapplets store](https://store.dapplets.org/).
