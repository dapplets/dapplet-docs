### Create Token

[More about ecosystem tokenomics](/docs/whitepapers/ecosystem-tokenomics-connection)

The Dapplets ecosystem is based on the AUGE token, which also uses a Bonding Curve. The DUC (Dapplet Under Construction) user is also encouraged to use a Bonding Curve, linking the dapplet token to the platform one.

In order to launch your own token using the proposed model, the user just needs to go through a clear step-by-step process that includes selecting a name and a ticker (short form) for the token. The curve will be created and will be available right after it.

#### Go to settings Dapplet Under Construction

#### Open Tokenomics page

It is only possible to create a token in each Dapplet Under Construction module once.

Click `CREATE` to create a token.

Enter Token Name (up to 17 characters).

And enter Token Ticker (from 3-4 characters).

Confirm token creation.

Confirm transaction and wait for the transaction to end.

#### Token created !
